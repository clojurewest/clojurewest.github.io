<p><strong>Dates: April 18-19th, 9 am - 5 pm (2 days)<br>
	Instructors: Alex Miller (<a href="http://twitter.com/puredanger">@puredanger</a>), Katherine Fellows (<a href="http://twitter.com/kf">@kf</a>)<br>
	Price: $300 (includes lunch both days)
</strong></p>

<p>This course is intended for new Clojure developers with prior programming experience. We expect that prior to the class you will have installed a REPL and spent a few hours reading an introductory Clojure text. Some recommended texts include <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>, <a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome">Clojure From the Ground Up</a>, <a href="http://amzn.com/B007Q4T040">Clojure Programming</a>, <a href="http://amzn.com/1934356867">Programming Clojure</a>, and <a href="http://amzn.com/1935182641">Practical Clojure</a>. Sessions will include some lecture but will primarily consist of hands-on guided labs and workshops.</p>

<p>The goal of the course is to achieve a thorough understanding of the basics of Clojure syntax and usage. Topics will include the Clojure syntax and evaluation model, collections, sequences, functions, flow control, namespaces, records, protocols, multimethods, and state.</p>

<p>The course covers two full days (Sat Apr 18 and Sun Apr 19, 9-5 pm) and includes lunch, snacks, and beverages both days (all other meals on your own). Wifi and power will be provided. Attendees are expected to bring a laptop - instructions will be sent later on workshop setup.</p>

<p><strong>About the instructors:</strong> Alex Miller works on Clojure and supports the community at Cognitect. He co-authored the forthcoming book, <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/vmclojeco/clojure-applied">Clojure Applied</a> (Pragmatic Press).</p>

<p>Katherine Fellows serves on the Board of Directors for ClojureBridge and enjoys teaching functional programming through Clojure. Currently, she's a Scala developer by trade, building distributed systems on the Core Application Platforms team at Comcast.</p>

<p><strong>Dates: April 19th, 9 am - 11 am (2 hrs)<br>
	Instructor: Colin Jones (<a href="http://twitter.com/trptcolin">@trptcolin</a>)<br>
        Price: $150</strong></p>

<p>In this workshop, which assumes only basic Clojure knowledge (see
Clojure Koans or any of the excellent introductory Clojure books),
we'll dig into how Clojure macros work, some tricks of the
macro-writing trade, and the inherent tradeoffs we must accept when we
reach for macros as a tool.</p>

<p>The workshop will include lecture and Q&A time, as well as plenty of
hands-on exercises to apply and practice the concepts we talk about.
Come with a laptop or a friend to pair with, and you'll leave with a
solid grasp of when and how to use macros (and also your laptop or
friend!).</p>

<p><strong>About the instructor:</strong> Colin Jones is director of software services at 8th Light, where he
crafts reliable, maintainable software for clients large and small.
He's worked on a number of open-source Clojure projects, including the
Clojure Koans, REPLy, Leiningen, and small contributions to Clojure
itself. Colin recently published his first book, 
<a href="https://pragprog.com/book/cjclojure/mastering-clojure-macros">Mastering Clojure Macros</a> (Pragmatic Press).</p>
