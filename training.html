<p>This course is intended for new Clojure developers with some programming experience in another language. We expect that prior to the class you will have installed a REPL and spent a few hours reading an introductory Clojure text. Some recommended texts include <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>, <a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome">Clojure From the Ground Up</a>, and <a href="http://amzn.com/1491909048">Living Clojure</a>. Sessions will include a mix of lecture and labs.</p>

<p>The goal of the course is to achieve a thorough understanding of the basics of Clojure syntax and usage. Topics will include the Clojure syntax and evaluation model, collections, sequences, functions, flow control, namespaces, records, protocols, multimethods, and state.</p>

<p>The course covers two full days (Wed Apr 13 and Thu Apr 14, 9-5 pm). Beverages and snack are provided on both days and lunch is provided on Wednesday.  Wifi and power will be provided. Attendees are expected to bring a laptop - instructions will be sent later on workshop setup.</p>

<p><strong>About the instructor:</strong> Alex Miller works on Clojure and supports the community at Cognitect. He co-authored the recent book, <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/vmclojeco/clojure-applied">Clojure Applied</a> (Pragmatic Press).</p>
