<p>Clojure/west is pleased to announce our first ever Opportunity Grant to support community members who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference or training for financial reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Grants are available for all traditionally under-represented groups in technology, including but not limited to African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, persons with disabilities and women (cis or trans). A preference will be given to applicants based in the United States. By submitting an application, you confirm that you are eligible under these criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Selection:</strong> Applications will be reviewed by a selected committee and will be accepted based upon need and impact. All information will be kept confidential by selection committee.</p>

<p><strong>Award:</strong> Applicants will receive a conference registration ticket and, if awarded, travel assistance and workshop ticket. If you are awarded a grant, you agree that you will attend all three days of the conference (Apr 20-22).</p>

<p><strong>Notification:</strong> All applicants will be notified via email with conference registration details and travel reimbursement details.</p>

<p><strong>Application:</strong> Fill out the Opportunity Grant application. Application information will be reviewed and notification will be distributed on a rolling basis.</p>

<p>All conference and event attendees are expected to adhere to the Clojure/west <a href="http://clojurewest.org/policies">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h2>Opportunity Grant Sponsorships</h2>

<p>We ran our first Opportunity Grant program last fall at Clojure/west and helped 12 community members. After the conference, one recipient wrote to us and said:</p>

<blockquote>“This single event might have changed the course of my career as an aspiring software engineer.”<br/>-- David V.</blockquote>

<p>For Clojure/west we would like to support 25 community members and will need at least $25,000 to reach our goal. We’ve currently raised $6,415 and have a ways to go. Every contribution helps to make a difference in our community! Here’s how your company can help:</p>
