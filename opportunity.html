				<p>Clojure/west is thrilled to provide Opportunity Grants to support community members from underrepresented groups who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference for financial reasons. The purpose of these grants is to remove obstacles to attendance while increasing the diversity of the Clojure community.</p>

				<p>We want you to apply!<br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Already attended a conference in the past? <em>That's ok.</em></li>
						<li>Already received a grant in the past? Still ok.</em></li>
						<li>Don't have much (or any) Clojure experience? <em>That's ok, we can help!</em></li>
						<li>Don't know anyone going? <em>We have a guide program and organized meetups!</em></li>
						<li>Don't want to take money away from someone else? <em>Really, it's ok, everyone says that!</em></li>
						<li>Don't feel like you deserve this? <em>That's also ok: you do.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Grants are available for all traditionally underrepresented groups in technology who would not be able to attend the conference for financial reasons. Awardees should plan to attend the full conference (April 15-16, 2016 in Seattle, WA). And of course, everybody needs to abide by the conference <a href="http://clojurewest.org/policies">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

				<p><strong>Selection:</strong> Applications will be reviewed by a diverse selection committee. By completing the application, you indicate that you meet the eligibility requirements.</p>

				<p>Due to limited funds, the selection committee will use the information provided (properly anonymized) to prioritize applicant grants based on these criteria:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Prior interest or investment in Clojure</li>
					<li>Involvement in a programming-oriented community (not necessarily Clojure)</li>
					<li>Likelihood of future community involvement</li>
					<li>Early submission - we award grants on a rolling basis and early submission is recommended</li>
					<li>US over international - to maximize the benefit of funds for travel, we primarily award grants to applicants from the United States</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The best way to help the selection committee is by providing detailed information in the application.</p>

				<p><strong>Award:</strong> If you are awarded a grant you will receive a conference registration ticket and, if requested, travel assistance.</p>

				<p><strong>Applications Close</strong>: Feb 19, 2016. If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:diversity@cognitect.com">diversity@cognitect.com</a>.</p>

				<p><strong>Notification:</strong> All applicants will be notified via email with conference registration details and (if applicable) travel reimbursement details. Notifications happen on a rolling basis. All notifications will be sent out by Feb 22, 2016.</p>

			<h2>Opportunity Grant Sponsorships</h2>

			<p>After our first Opportunity Grant program, one recipient wrote to us and said:</p>

			<blockquote>“This single event might have changed the course of my career as an aspiring software engineer.”</blockquote>

			<p>For Clojure/west 2016 we would like to support 25 community members at an approximate cost of $20,000. Every contribution helps to make a difference in our community! Here’s how your company can help:</p>
