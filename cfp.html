      <h2>Topics</h2>

      <p>Talks are 40 minutes, including questions and answers.</p>
      <p>Clojure/West will have two parallel rooms featuring talks in the following categories:</p>
      <ul>
	      <li>Language - language talks </li>
	      <li>Experience Report - <li>
	      <li>Library - </li>
	      <li>Ideas - </li>
	      <li>Tools - </li>
	      <li>Fun - </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Attendees can also <a href="https://github.com/clojurewest/clojurewest2016/wiki/Suggested-Topics">submit topic ideas</a> that others might be able to speak about. Speakers should feel free to draw from this list of ideas while writing their submissions.</p>

      <h2>How We Can Help</h2>

      <p>Everyone who is interested in submitting a talk proposal to Clojure/West is encouraged to do so, regardless of experience level. We welcome proposals from less experienced speakers and will work with you to help you prepare. We would also like to actively encourage submissions from individuals who consider themselves underrepresented on stage at technical conferences.  If you are considering a talk, here’s how we can help!</p>

      <ul>
	      <li>Brainstorm your interests to see if a great topic is hiding</li>
	      <li>Connect you with an experienced mentor to help prepare your submission or talk</li>
	      <li>Review and advise on how to produce slides</li>
	      <li>Find opportunities to practice your talk</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Again, whatever else you might need, we’re here to help. Email us at <a href="mailto:events@cognitect.com">events@cognitect.com</a></p>

      <h2>Speaker Perks</h2>

      <p>Speakers receive:</p>
      <ul>
	      <li>Ticket to Clojure/West 2016. If you purchase your conference ticket before speaker announcements, we will reimburse you.</li>
	      <li>Up to 3 nights stay at the conference hotel. We can also help arrange a longer visit (at your expense).</li>
	      <li>U.S. airfare or up to $550 international</li>
	      <li><em>In some circumstances we can also provide additional support - please let us know!</em></li>
      </ul>

      <p>If your employer can cover your travel and/or hotel, we are happy to list them as a sponsor in exchange.</p>

      <p>All talks will be recorded and published online at <a href="http://youtube.com/ClojureTV">ClojureTV</a>.</p>
      <h2>Selection Process</h2>

      <ul>
	      <li><strong>Pre-screen</strong> - on submission, talks are reviewed for applicability and quality. Sometimes we will request changes or additional information. The earlier you submit, the more likely we can work with you to address issues! In rare cases, we will decline a talk that is not at all on-topic.</li>
	      <li><strong>Review</strong> - submissions are reviewed (without speaker details) and rated by a group of Clojure developers. The reviewers are a diverse group including people both in and out of Cognitect. The ratings and feedback are used to establish an initial sort order for the submissions.</li>
	      <li><strong>Selection</strong> - the selection committees reviews all talks, ratings, reviews, and additional speaker information to select the program. There are always far more qualified talks than we have room to accept and choices are made to provide a program that balances topics, tracks, companies, and speakers.</li>
	      <li><strong>Feedback</strong> - due to the volume of talks, we typically do not provide feedback for every submission. We try to catch and fix the majority of abstracts with issues during pre-screening so in most cases talks are not accepted due to issues of balance.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We expect to receive 100-200 submissions for 20-25 speaking slots.</p>
