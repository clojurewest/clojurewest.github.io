      <h2>Important Dates</h2>
        <ul>
	        <li>Jan 4 - Call for Presentations Opens</li>
	        <li>Jan 29 - Call for Presentations Closes</li>

      <h2>Topics</h2>

      <p>Talks are 40 minutes, including questions and answers. Clojure/West will have two session rooms 
				featuring talks in the following categories:</p>
      <ul>
	      <li>Language - features of Clojure or ClojureScript, how they are implemented, or how to use them effectively</li>
	      <li>Experience Report - how your project or organization is succeeding with Clojure or ClojureScript</li>
	      <li>Library - how to use a particular library</li>
	      <li>Tools - how to use a particular tool</li>
	      <li>Ideas - design, architecture, or other ideas about programming with Clojure</li>
	      <li>Fun - art, games, or other less serious uses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Attendees can also <a href="https://github.com/clojurewest/clojurewest2016/wiki/Suggested-Topics">submit topic ideas</a> that others might be able to speak about. Speakers should feel free to draw from this list of ideas while writing their submissions.</p>

      <h2>How We Can Help</h2>

      <p>Everyone who is interested in submitting a talk proposal to Clojure/West is encouraged to do so, regardless of experience level. We welcome proposals from less experienced speakers and will work with you to help you prepare. We would also like to actively encourage submissions from individuals who consider themselves underrepresented on stage at technical conferences.  If you are considering a talk, here’s how we can help:</p>

      <ul>
	      <li>Provide feedback and prioritization of potential ideas</li>
	      <li>Connect you with an experienced mentor for your submission or talk</li>
	      <li>Review your slides or content and provide advice</li>
	      <li>Find opportunities to practice your talk</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We’re here to help. Email us at <a href="mailto:events@cognitect.com">events@cognitect.com</a></p>

      <h2>Speaker Perks</h2>

      <p>Speakers receive:</p>
      <ul>
	      <li>Ticket to Clojure/West 2016 (reimbursed if purchased before speakers announced)</li>
	      <li>Up to 3 nights stay at the conference hotel</li>
	      <li>U.S. airfare or up to $550 international</li>
	      <li>In some circumstances we can also provide additional support</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All talks are recorded and published online at <a href="http://youtube.com/ClojureTV">ClojureTV</a>.</p>

      <h2>Selection Process</h2>

      <ul>
	      <li>Pre-screen - talks are given a cursory review on submission and we will sometimes request changes or additional information. The earlier you submit, the more likely we can work with you to address issues!</li>
	      <li>Review - submissions are anonymized and reviewed by a group of Clojure developers. The reviewers are a diverse group including people both in and out of Cognitect. The ratings and feedback are used to establish an initial sort order for selection.</li>
	      <li>Selection - the selection committees reviews all talks, ratings, reviews, and additional speaker information to select the program. There are always more qualified talks than we can accept and the committee selects a program that balances topics, tracks, companies, and speakers.</li>
	      <li>Feedback - due to the volume of talks, we do not provide feedback for most submissions, although we can provide some additional guidance on request.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We expect to receive 100-200 submissions for 20-25 speaking slots.</p>
