							<h3>Types are like the Weather, Type Systems are like Weathermen</h3>

							<p>Whether you checked the weather app or not on the day before 22 Jan 2016, a huge snow storm covered the Eastern United States that weekend.  If you lived in New York or DC, you had to dig out from under a large load of snow the next morning.</p>
<p>In the face of such storms, the good news is that people have almost perfected the art of weather prediction over the past few decades. A snow storm or hurricane will no longer catch anyone by surprise. If we act on these predictions in time, we can easily prevent the bad disasters of the days gone by.</p>
<p>My keynote will expand on this theme. Bring an umbrella.</p>

							<span class="bio"><p>Bio: Matthias Felleisen is the Chief Philosopher and Shepherd (CPS) of PLT, the research group behind Racket.  As such he is responsible for thinking deep thoughts about the language, pronouncing his insights in obscure email messages, and herding cats while increasing their numbers.</p>
<p>After spending 10 years on mathematical models of programming and languages, Felleisen set out in 1994 to convince middle schools, high schools, and colleges to ditch dysfunctional programming and introduce functional programming instead as a straight extension and reinforcement of basic school algebra. Racket, the * Student Languages, DrRacket, "How to Design Programs", Typed Racket, and many more pieces of practical software are  side-effects of this 20-year outreach project.</p>
<p>Years ago, Felleisen collaborated with Daniel Friedman on "little" books, especially the Little Schemer (nee Lisper). More recently, he co-authored Realm of Racket with eight freshman students. ACM and its organizations have honored Felleisen's work with some awards.</p></span>

<p>The concept of what makes something a work of art has always been a contentious topic. As technology has advanced, so have the ideas of what constitutes art and the mediums with which art is created. From Clojure performance artists REPL Electric and Meta-ex to artists of the Fluxus movement, the medium and act of creation has been intrinsically tied to the piece itself. Moving backwards through history from today's interactive works created with Clojure and Overtone to Lisp AI painters of the 90s and multimedia auteurs of the 70s, let's explore how art has evolved into its current landscape. </p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> As a student of Digital Media and Computer Science, Allison has always been fascinated by the intersection of computing and art. Her work has included mixed and augmented reality games and interactive digital installations. She has been fascinated by Lisp since first learning Scheme at Georgia Tech, and is currently a software engineer at Houseplans in San Francisco.</p></div>

<p>The simplicity of the Clojure language and the supportive, collaborative spirit of its community played a pivotal role in my success as a junior engineer. I felt frustrated with cryptic 'method_missing' stack traces in my first years of programming, and Clojure reshaped the way I saw code and data. We will examine elements of the language that help and hinder newcomers, ways in which teams can better support junior developers, and how companies can create value by investing in upcoming talent. Living wage apprenticeships for developers can provide opportunities for a richer, more diverse tech industry.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> This past year, my Little Bird team and I rewrote our social network graph analysis application with Clojure and ClojureScript. I started as an intern and built internal tools that eventually became user-facing features. I currently write product specification software with React.js at Jama.

<p>Old-school adventure games were infamous for their mind-bending logic. While you might pull quite a bit of hair playing one, writing one can be a lot more fun, especially when written in Clojure. We will embark on a quest, examining how some of Clojure's features, libraries, and functional paradigms can bring some sanity and simplicity into the otherwise complex world of game development. We'll look at how to model SCUMM-style dialogue trees, write in-game cutscene scripts, and build a game while it's running using an nREPL server. </p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Bryce's interest in software development began while playing old-school adventure games in the early nineties. He's been busy writing code ever since -- by day a web application developer, and by night a game developer.

<p>This talk is about building Clojure/Clojurescript web applications with Datomic and DataScript.  In addition to covering the basics of syncing data between client and server, we'll look at how reactive Datalog queries simplify front end code, how Datomic's flexible and queryable schema lets us describe UI with data, and how we can handle authorization in this setting.  In closing, we'll reflect on the big picture of this architecture in relation to current trends in FRP.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Chris is a computational biologist, data scientist, web developer and Clojure enthusiast.

<p>Datomic has a fantastic Clojure API that is simple and data-driven, but too low level to directly express certain restrictions on the shape and types of data living on the database.</p><p>spec-tacular is a DSL that lives between Clojure and Datomic and enforces extra restrictions on data types (via a specification language) by providing concise syntactic shortcuts to create, update, and query those well-typed entities from Clojure.  Unfortunately, the resulting language (as implemented) has unreasonable restrictions that do not compensate for the corresponding loss of expressive power.</p><p>In this talk, I'll present the design of spec-tacular and describe how well it lives up to my vision of a healthy layer of abstraction over Datomic.  I'll discuss the success of spec-tacular features in production, and trace failures back to poor language design.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Claire works at SparkFund, where she develops software in Clojure that schedules and executes financial transactions.

<p>Web development has an undeserved reputation. Many in our industry hesitate to call it "real programming," yet designing even the simplest web application draws upon deep traditions in networked computing.</p><p>In this webdev real talk, we are going back to the beginning. We will graph out the advancement of web systems from their humble origins, and, with each new storage and rendering component, watch the architectures of today's massive web systems emerge. Then, we will explore recent works from members of the greater Clojure community that push the boundaries of this era in our distributed web.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Mikaela Patella is a meat computer who produces multimedia works, software, and screencasts . She also works with Yet Analytics as a Senior Software Engineer to help make collecting, exploring, and interacting with data more humane.</p></div>

<p>When writing Clojure or ClojureScript, it is very common to make use of data structures that are combinations of maps, lists, vectors, and other data structures. It is very common to query for nested elements in a data structure, or to transform only parts of a data structure. This kind of code tends to be highly nested, hard to follow, and error-prone. Specter is a library that gives you the power to write these queries and transformations concisely and elegantly - with performance rivaling hand-optimized code. In this session you will learn the basics of Specter and why it has near-universal applicability for Clojure and ClojureScript programming.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Nathan has been programming Clojure for over 90% of his work for over 5 years. He used Clojure to create the Apache Storm project, one of the most popular Big Data processing frameworks in the world. The companies using Storm as core infrastructure include Yahoo!, Spotify, Groupon, Alibaba, Yelp, The Weather Channel, WebMD, and many more. In 2015 he published the book "Big Data: principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems". He advises companies in areas such as virtual reality, education, and health, and he is currently working on a new startup.</p></div>

<p>Functional programming suggests that the best way to comprehend a world in flux is with abstractions that are declarative and immutable. However, most of the approaches we have at hand are suited for discrete changes: tools like refs, atoms, and agents can't effectively describe continuous or gradual change. Hybrid automata combine the discrete nature of finite automata with the continuous nature of differential equations to offer a powerful and succinct way to describe continuous systems, and they have been used to model everything from microbial ecosystems to macroeconomic equilibria. In this talk we will see how hybrid automata provide a programming model that helps us manage the complexity of flowing time without a calculus degree. We will also show how SparkFund uses hybrid automata and Clojure to navigate a world of cash flows, interest rates, and financial contracts.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Nathan works at SparkFund, where he uses Clojure and Datomic to help finance energy efficiency projects. Throughout his career he has exclaimed many times: "I can't believe I've made it this far without knowing about X!" He hopes that giving the occasional talk about X will help those who feel similarly.</p></div>

<p>Braid is an open-source group chat application for teams and communities, designed to promote productive conversations and aiming to be an alternative to Slack for open source groups such as the Clojurian community. From its inception Braid was intended to be a showcase of the awesomeness of Clojure/script and the ability of the Clojure community to satisfy its own needs. For rapid development and flexibility, Braid is leveraging Clojure, ClojureScript, Om, and Datomic. And with its innovative approach to conversation management, Braid is anything but an IRC clone. Come explore new ways of thinking about messages, chat, conversations, tags, threads, channels, rooms, groups, teams, organizations, federation, balkanization and community.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> A programmer/developer/designer for 30 years.

<p>While often conflated with its syntax, Datalog is actually the system defining the set of semantics used by many database query languages, including SQL, SPARQL, and Datomic queries. However, Datalog also defines semantics for "Production Rules", allowing logic programs to be executed similarly to Prolog.</p><p>Datomic allows the definition of "rules" for queries, but these do not include the functionality of production rules or Datalog programming. This talk discusses a production rules library built with the Rete algorithm, automating Datalog programs, while avoiding intermediate states in Datomic. An extended schema vocabulary is also shown, which allows the automation of some rule definitions, along with reducing the execution complexity.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> A computer engineer, quantum physicist, and Semantic Web geek, Paula is most at home working in the lower layers of systems, building the infrastructure that lets other developers do their jobs. She was a senior developer on Tucana, the first commercial RDF database, and the lead developer on Mulgara, which was an open source version. She has built 2 commercial rules engines, one in Clojure, and is the middle of building the third. When not coding, she is busy doing Taekwondo with her daughter, cooking, and staying up late to talk to friends online.</p></div>

<p>Since it's invention the Hash Array Mapped Trie has grown to become the defacto Immutable Hash Map implementation. However there is still room for big improvements with this central data structure. It's possible to get speedups of 100% for iteration and equality checking.

<p>The ability to interact with and modify a running program is one of the great strengths of modern programming languages.
